The Project Gutenberg Etext of Mr Honey's Small Business Dictionary (German-English)?******This file should be named 8smde10.txt or 8smde10.zip******

This Etext prepared by Michael Pullen,?globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com.
We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing. Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after the official publication date.
Please note: neither this list nor its contents are final till midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement. The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish to do so.
Most people start at our sites at:?http://gutenberg.net?http://promo.net/pg
Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.
http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext02?or?ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02
Or /etext01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90
Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want, as it appears in our Newsletters.
Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. This projected audience is one hundred million readers. If our value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2 million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+ If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext Files by December 31, 2001. [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion] This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers, which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we manage to get some real funding.
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.
We need your donations more than ever!

This is a work in progress dictionary of phrases commonly used. This book contains English and equivalent German phrases. We are releasing two versions of this book, sorted for the English reader and sorted for the German reader.
Dieses Buch wurde uns freundlicherweise von dem Verfasser zur Verf¨¹gung gestellt.?This book was generously donated to us by the author.
------------------Acknowledgement:?In the 1970s Winfried Honig, known as Mr Honey, started compiling and computerizing English/German dictionaries, partly to provide his colleagues and students with samples of the language of business, partly to collect convincing material for his State Department of Education to illustrate the need for special dictionaries covering the special language used in different branches of the industry.
In 1997 Mr Honey began to feed his wordlists into the LEO Online Dictionary http://dict.leo.org of the Technische Universit?t M¨¹nchen, and in 2000 into the DicData Online Dictionary http://www.dicdata.de
While more than 500.000 daily visitors use the online versions, CD-ROM versions are available, see: http://www.leo.org/dict/cd_en.html http://www.dicdata.de http://mrhoney.purespace.de/latest.htm Mr. Honey would be pleased to answer questions sent to?winfried.honig@online.de.

History and Philosophy
Die Anf?nge dieses W?rterbuches gehen zur¨¹ck in die Zeit als England der Europ?ischen Gemeinschaft beitreten wollte.
In einer Gemeinschaftsarbeit von BBC, British Council, dem Dept. of Educ. und der OUP machte man sich Gedanken, wie man dem?F¨¹hrungsnachwuchs auf dem Kontinent die englische Wirtschaftssprache beibringen k?nnte.
Als einer der wenigen Dozenten, die damals in London?Wirtschaftsenglisch lehrten, kam ich in Kontakt mit dem Projekt.
Da ich mich zu jener Zeit f¨¹r eine Karriere in der Daten-verarbeitung oder als Hochschullehrer f¨¹r Wirtschaftsenglisch entscheiden musste, w?hlte ich eine Kombination von beidem.
Als Dozent der FH machte ich den Einsatz von Multimedia in der Vermittlung von brauchbarem Wirtschaftsenglisch zu meiner Aufgabe.
F¨¹r die Anforderungen verschiedener Seminare, Schwerpunkte, Zielgruppen entstanden aus der praktischen Arbeit die Wortlisten und W?rterb¨¹cher.
Aufgewachsen und geschult in der praktischen Denkweise von A.S. Hornby, einem Fellow des University College London, legte ich besonderen Wert auf die hohe Zahl m?glichst dienlicher?Anwendungsbeispiele.
Die indizierten sequentiellen Wortlisten der Kompaktversionen, --anders und meines Erachtens noch viel besser--die gro?en?sequentiellen Wortlisten der CD-ROM-Versionen mit der stufenweisen bis globalen Suche in den Wort- und Beispiellisten zunehmenden Umfangs, erm?glichen eine optimale sprachliche Orientierung in einem umfangreichen wirtschaftlichen Sprachsschatz.
Dabei sehe ich neue Wege und M?glichkeiten des Erwerbs und des Umgangs mit der Fachsprache.
Wahrscheinlich bietet sich hier weit mehr als sich im ersten Eindruck erahnen l??t. Spielerisch sollte es m?glich sein, leichter, schneller und intensiver zu lernen.
Durch die Vielzahl der Assoziationen d¨¹rfte sich schneller als bisher eine gehobene fachsprachliche Kompetenz entwickeln.
